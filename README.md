Village Law is a mod that aims to increase immersion in Minecraft Villages by adding consequences to actions that could be considered "crimes" in civilized locations. No longer will your Villagers only stare somewhat judgingly as you kidnap their parents and steal their food, now they will take offense, and call for help!



Features:

- A performance friendly law system that only takes affect in Villages. This system is lightweight, and runs off of an efficient LOS function created for this mod. If you aren't seen, you aren't in trouble.


- Villagers respond to Vandalism, Theft, Arson, and Kidnapping attempts. If you are seen committing any of these crimes, villagers will drop thier oppinion of you, and call for help! This lead to some intrigueing strategies to steal from villages during testing, such as creating a tunnel system to steal from villagers when they are away from home.


- A new mob that acts as a "Sheriff" of sorts in Villages, the Guardian of Law. Guardians of Law are more powerful versions of Iron Golems that are created when an Iron Golem bears witness to a crime in a Village. There may only be one per village.


- Block protection in Villages in a certain radius around Guardians of Law. If no Guardian of Law exists in a Cillage yet, it is considered "Lawless" as niave Villagers have not yet been exposed to the selfishness of players. This can quickly change if you are noticed pillaging, however!


- A block that allows players to have immunity in their own villages, the Beacon of Authority. These blocks are created from the Law Cores that Guardians of Law possess, and may only be placed outside of existing villages. If you want to create a village with a Beacon of Authority, place one first, then move your Villagers in.


- Modular configuration for those who like some aspects of this mod, but dislike others. Would you like to be punished for stealing, but not vandalism? It's easily changable in the config.


Compatibility:

Village Law should be compatible with most village mods, including MCA, and Village Guards. This is because it uses Minecraft's built in Village Gossip system to work, and affects any mob in a Village that includes "villager" in their registry name.
